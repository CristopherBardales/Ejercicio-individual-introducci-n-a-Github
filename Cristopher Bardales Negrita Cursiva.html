        <i>Nobody’s</i> born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, <b>certainly</b> can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <i>Einstein</i> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <b>Shakespeare</b> had to <b>learn</b> his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are <b>born</b> to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. <i>You</i> stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <i>Frustrating.</i> Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another <b>word</b> for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        <i>Because</i> the most <b>beautiful</b>, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, <i>wherever</i> you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
